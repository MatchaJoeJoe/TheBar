  storyText: "At first you think your arm is broken, but the back of the chair has
    splintered. You manage to get your arm free and remove your bindings. You pull
    the bag off your head and see you're in a small, windowless room with a wooden
    staircase leading up to a door. The only light is a small bulb at the top of the
    stairs hanging from a cord.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r"
