  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: You lurch your body to the side, trying desperately to move the chair,
    towards what you don't know. The leg catches on something on the floor and starts
    to lean. You try to push your body the other direction, but it's too late, you're
    falling. You tense yourself for impact and hear a loud cracking sound and a sharp
    pain in your arm.
