  storyText: "Eventually, you hear the jingle of keys and the scraping of a door on
    stone. You hear steps on a creaky old staircase. The bag is yanked from your head
    and a large man is silhouetted from the light behind him. The barman looks at
    you for a moment, but you can't make out his face in the shadow. He turns toward
    the light, walks over to a small table and pulls out a wicked looking dagger,
    bent and crooked.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?"
