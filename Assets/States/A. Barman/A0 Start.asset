  storyText: After a long, miserable, rainy day, your umbrella breaks just outside
    a bar. You've been down this street a thousand times and have never seen this
    bar before, it must be new. You stand outside a few moments, debating whether
    or not to go in, and finally decide you wouldn't mind a warm, dry place to have
    a drink while you wait for the rain to let up.
