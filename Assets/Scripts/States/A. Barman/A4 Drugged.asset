  storyText: "The barman slides your drink across the counter with a nod. You hold
    it in your hand, watching the rain out the window. You take a drink and notice
    it doesn't quite taste right. There's a chemical aftertaste that burns the back
    of your throat. \n\nYou try to say something to the barman, but all that comes
    out is a hoarse croak. Your vision blurs and goes black. You hear shuffling around
    you and feel a strong grip on your shoulder before losing consciousness.\r"
