  storyText: "As the blade presses against the soft flesh under your chin, you hear
    a loud crack like someone slamming a two-by-four against a stone wall, but louder,
    more violent. The man's face explodes outward and bits of bone and grey matter
    are splattered across the wall and floor. Your ears are ringing. As his body collapses,
    you see the woman from the bar at the top of the stairs, holding a smoking gun,
    arms shaking, tears running down her face.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r"
