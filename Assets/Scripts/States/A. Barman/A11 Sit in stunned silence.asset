  storyText: As you sit there, stunned by what just happened, the woman slowly walks
    down the stairs, tears flowing freely down her face. As she bends to take the
    knife from his still twitching fingers, you hear her whisper, "I'm sorry," before
    she cuts your binds and walks slowly back upstairs and out the door, into the
    rain.
