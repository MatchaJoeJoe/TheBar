  storyText: "You step through the door, soaked to the bone and dripping, and find
    a simple bar, a little bare, but cozy. The smell of stale beer and dust fills

    behind the bar, cleaning a glass with a towel, and a woman sitting at the bar,
    sipping a fruity looking drink.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r"
