  storyText: "You start sobbing. You cry until snot and spit start running down your
    chin into your shirt. You cry until you can't cry anymore.\r\n\nHours pass. You
    are getting hungry. You need to use the bathroom. You try to hold it for as long
    as you can, but you soil yourself. You're scared and alone in a dark room. You
    can't see, can't move, can't call out. You're trapped.\r\n\nWhat do you do?\r"
